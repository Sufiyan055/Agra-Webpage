        <strong>Taj Mahal</strong>
        <p>
          One of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal is located on the
          banks of River Yamuna in Agra. It was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah
          Jahan as a memorial for his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses
          the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. Constructed entirely out of white
          marble in the 17th century, Taj Mahal is one of the most beautiful
          monuments in the world. Every year visitors numbering more than the
          entire population of Agra pass through the magnificent gates to catch
          a glimpse of this breathtaking monument! <br />
          A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Taj Mahal stands for the Crown of
          Palaces in the Persian language. The tomb is laid out in a rectangular
          shape and can be approached through a massive gateway which has an
          arch and alcoves on either side of it. There are water channels and
          fountains in the entrance which makes the monument even more
          spectacular. The reflection of this majestic spectacle in the Yamuna
          is almost poetic in its perfection! Covering an area of approximately
          42 Acres, the construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1631 and it took
          17 years before it was completed in 1648! It was constructed using
          white marble obtained from Makrana in Rajasthan.

        <strong>Agra Fort</strong>
        <p>
          An architectural masterpiece, The Red Fort of Agra or Agra Fort was
          built by Emperor Akbar in 1573. It is located on the right bank of the
          River Yamuna and is made entirely of red sandstone. The historical
          fort was once the ersthwhile residence of the Mughals until 1638. One
          of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, it lies 2.5 kilometres from Taj
          Mahal. Also known as Lal –Qila, Fort Rouge or Qila-i-Akbari, Agra Fort
          is a symbol of Agra and is so massive that it is often referred to as
          a walled city. It is the perfect example of Mughal art and
          architecture, built purely out of red sandstone. Within the premises
          of Agra Fort lie the most exquisite structures like the Pearl Mosque,
          Diwan-i I Khas, Diwan-i I Aam, Moti Masjid and Jahangiri Mahal. Some
          part of the Agra Fort is used by the Indian Army is off-limit to
          public access. View of Yamuna River and Taj Mahal from the fort's
          pavilions is mind-stirring.

        <strong>Fatehpur Sikri</strong>
        <p>
          Located at a distance of 40km from Agra, Fatehpur Sikri is a town in
          the Agra district and a famous tourist attraction. A city
          predominantly made of red sandstone, Fatehpur Sikri was founded in
          1571 century by Mughal Emperor Akbar. It is essentially a fortified
          city built by the king and had been the capital of his Empire for
          fifteen years. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, it is home to Jodha
          Bai's Palace, Jama Mosque, Buland Darwaza, and Tomb of Salim Chisti
          among many other famous monuments. Derived from Arab and central Asian
          tent encampments, the Imperial Complex is a work of pavilions arranged
          in formal geometry on a piece of land. A unique blend of architectural
          excellence, as well as religious beliefs - sums up Fatehpur Sikri. It
          was built by Akbar to honour Sheikh Salim Chisti, whose prediction of
          the birth of a Mughal heir came true while Akbar was visiting the then
          city of Sikri. In honour of the prophecy, Akbar built this city and
          Jama Masjid, a stunning mosque which is still in use today. He also
          undertook the construction of three palaces for each of his favourite
          wives, one a Hindu, one a Muslim and one a Christian. An Indo-Islamic
          Masterpiece, Fatehpur Sikri look its resplendent best during sunset.

        <strong>Tomb of Itimad-ud-Daulah</strong>
        <p>
          Often referred to as the "Baby Taj Mahal", the tomb of
          Itimad-ud-daulah is a Mughal mausoleum and often regarded as a copy of
          the Taj Mahal. This is the first tomb in India made entirely of
          marble. The tomb was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir,
          for her father Mir Gheyas Beg (later known as Itimad-ud-daulah), who
          was a minister in the court of Shah Jahan. The tomb of
          Itimad-ud-daulah marks the transition from the first phase of the
          Mughal architecture to the second. This was the first structure to
          make use of pietra dura and the first to be built on the banks of the
          Yamuna River. It basically consists of Indo-Islamic architecture, with
          the use of arched entrances and octagonal shaped towers. If you take a
          bird's eye of Itimad-ud-daulah Tomb, it looks like a jewel box set in
          a garden. This magnificent mausoleum, built on the banks of Yamuna,
          was to inspire the construction of one of the wonders of the world
          "Taj Mahal" in the later years.

          The residential palace of Jahangir Mahal, stands tall in the Agra Fort
          complex. Built by Akbar, in the 17th Century, this Red Sandstone
          marvel is a multi-storeyed palace with a series of courtyards running
          from north to south, along the eastern fort wall. The palace is
          located north of Akbari Mahal, another important Mughal marvel that
          now breathes in its ruins and faces the river Jamuna. One of the most
          popular tourist places in Agra, the Jahangir Mahal served as a private
          residence to Akbar’s son and successor, Jahangir. The Jahangir Mahal
          is one of the first buildings you would come across when you enter
          Agra through the Amar Singh Gate.

        <strong>1. Agra Fort Was Not Built By Shah Jahan</strong>
        <p>
          Whenever someone questions about the history of Agra Fort, we always
          end up saying it was built by Shah Jahan, a Mughal King, in the early
          17th century. But do you know the Agra Fort was actually constructed
          as a brick fort by the Rajput kings before the Mughal dynasty came
          into power? Later on, it was controlled by the Lodis until the Mughal
          King Akbar renovated it by using red sandstone. However, the current
          building of the fort was shaped by Shah Jahan.

        <strong>2. Yamuna River At Agra Was Called Blue River</strong>
        <p>
          You wouldn't believe if we say that the polluted Yamuna river was once
          called the Blue River on account of its pristine waters. Yes, it was
          so transparent and clear that one could have clearly seen its river
          bed with naked eyes. Today, it has become one of the most contaminated
          and infected rivers in the country. Only if it could retain its
          original beauty, it would be another wonder of Agra.

          Sultanate, in the early 16th century. But to your surprise, Agra was

      <p>
        Agra, city, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. It lies in the
        Indo-Gangetic Plain on the Yamuna (Jumna) River about 125 miles (200 km)
        southeast of Delhi.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an early reference to an “Agravana” in the ancient Sanskrit
        epic Mahabharata, and Ptolemy is said to have called the site “Agra.”
        The city was founded by Sultan Sikandar of the Lodī dynasty in the early
        16th century to be the capital of the Delhi sultanate. Agra also served
        as the Mughal capital during some periods of that empire. In the late
        18th century the city fell successively to the Jats, the Marathas, the
        Mughals, the ruler of Gwalior, and, finally, the British in 1803. It was
        the capital of Agra (later North-Western) province from 1833 to 1868 and
        was one of the main centres of the Indian Mutiny (1857–58).
      </p>
      <p>
        Agra is best known for the Taj Mahal (17th century), designated a UNESCO
        World Heritage site in 1983. A complex mausoleum, the Taj Mahal is often
        considered to be the world’s best example of Mughal architecture. The
        Mughal emperor Shah Jahān built it for his favourite wife, Mumtāz Maḥal,
        in the mid-17th century. Agra Fort (16th century), called the Red Fort
        for its massive red sandstone walls, was built by the emperor Akbar; it
        contains the Pearl Mosque (Moti Masjid; 17th century), constructed of
        white marble, and a palace, the Jahangiri Mahal. The fort was also
        designated a World Heritage site in 1983.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Jāmiʿ Masjid, or Great Mosque, and the elegant tomb of Iʿtimād
        al-Dawlah (1628), of white marble, are located near the Taj Mahal. To
        the northwest, at Sikandra, is the tomb of Akbar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agra is a major road and rail junction and a commercial and industrial
        centre known for its leather goods, cut stone, and handwoven carpets.
        Tourism is a major factor in the city’s economy. The city is the seat of
        Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University (formerly Agra University), founded in
        1927. The suburbs of Agra contain the state psychiatric hospital and
        Dayalbagh, a colony of the Radha Soami Satsang religious sect (founded
        in the city in 1861).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many religious and cultural festivals are held in Agra. Janamashtami
        commemorates the birthday of Lord Krishna. The annual Taj Mahotsav, a
        10-day arts, crafts, and music carnival, usually in February, is held in
        Shilpagram, a crafts village close to the Taj Mahal.
